## Introduction

The Convex Hull of a set of points in three-dimensional space is the smallest convex polyhedron that encloses all the points. It has applications in various fields including computer graphics, robotics, and simulations. This implementation provides an efficient algorithm to compute the 3D Convex Hull.

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Input**: Read the 3D points from an input source (file, user input, etc.).
2. **Pre-processing**: Perform any necessary pre-processing, sorting, or initial steps on the input points.
3. **Convex Hull Computation**: Apply the convex hull algorithm to compute the convex hull of the input points.
4. **Output**: Obtain the vertices and edges of the convex hull as the result.

## Usage

To use the 3D Convex Hull algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TalSchreiber95/Convex-Hull-3d.git

2. Compile the code if needed.

3. Run the program, providing the necessary input (input file, command line arguments, etc.).

4. The program will output the vertices and edges of the computed convex hull.


### Clone the repository
First clone the repository using:
 ``` git clone https://github.com/TalSchreiber95/Convex-Hull-3d.git```
then move to the main file to run the algo:
 ``` cd main ```



### Use appropriate compiler commands here and Run the program with input.txt as input
./main
The program will read the points from ``` input1 (1).txt ``` (you can change it to other input files that in the project) and output the vertices and edges of the computed 3D convex hull.
